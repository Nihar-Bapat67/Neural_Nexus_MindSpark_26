## 💡 Problem, Impact and Scope

### Problem context

Structured products are hard for relationship managers (RMs) to configure and harder for clients to understand. A coupon
quoted in isolation hides the barrier, the issuer dependence and the worst thing that has actually happened to the underlying.
Suitability checks are then done by hand, in a different tool, and explained in jargon.

Neural Nexus puts all of it in one place. An RM can:

| Step | Capability |
|---|---|
| **Configure** | Pick a product type, underlying, tenor, strike / barrier and coupon. Terms are validated against configurable bounds. |
| **Visualise** | Payoff at maturity, a scenario table (−30 % … +20 %), break-even, maximum loss / gain, indicative fair-value check. |
| **Replay history** | Replay the exact terms on **20 real past market periods** of the same length, plus rolling-window statistics (probability of loss, CVaR, histogram, crisis presets) and an optional block-bootstrap Monte Carlo. |
| **Check suitability** | Deterministic rules compare the product with the client's risk appetite, horizon, loss tolerance, concentration, complexity, life stage, affordability, liquidity and compliance gates. |
| **Explain** | A plain-language explanation for the client and a technical briefing for the RM, generated from computed facts only. |
| **Recommend and fix** | Rank a grid of candidate products for a client, or suggest term changes that resolve a mismatch. |
| **Audit** | Every complete analysis is appended to a SHA-256 hash chain. |

### Impact matrix

| Workflow | Typical manual process | Neural Nexus |
|---|---|---|
| 📐 **Payoff maths** | Re-implemented per spreadsheet; formulas drift | **One implementation** of each payoff, shared by replay, scenarios, Monte Carlo, recommendations and the API |
| 🕰️ **Backtesting** | A single hand-picked "good" period | **20 real past periods** per product, always including the worst, best and most recent |
| ⚖️ **Suitability** | Judgement call, often undocumented | Deterministic, versioned rules; any `FAIL` ⇒ **NOT_SUITABLE**, any `REVIEW` ⇒ **REVIEW_REQUIRED** |
| 🗣️ **Client explanation** | Jargon-heavy term sheet | Plain-language text where **every number must exist in the computed facts** |
| 🛡️ **Capital protection** | Described as "safe" | Issuer credit risk shown as an explicit figure; never called risk-free |
| 🧾 **Audit** | Email trail | **SHA-256 hash chain** of every analysis (tamper-evident) |
| 📴 **Availability** | Needs a live data terminal | Prices fall back **live → disk cache → bundled seed CSV**, and every response states its source and `as_of` date |
| 🧪 **Verification** | Untested spreadsheets | **237 backend + 6 frontend tests**, fully offline |

### System scope

- **Best for:** demonstrating and evaluating a suitability-aware structured-product workflow; RM training; reviewing how a
  verdict was reached.
- **Not for:** live trading, order booking, issuer quoting, or regulated suitability sign-off.
- **Surfaces**

| Route | Audience | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Anyone | Landing page |
| `/login`, `/client/register`, `/rm/register` | Anyone | Sign-in and onboarding |
| `/client`, `/client/profile` | Client | Questionnaire, recommendation and explanation in plain language |
| `/rm` | Relationship manager | Full configurator, replay, suitability assessment, recommendations |
| `/dashboard/:runId` | Both | Full analysis view of a saved run |

## 🧱 Products and Payoff Conventions

There is **exactly one implementation of each payoff formula** (`backend/app/simulation/sim_engine/payoffs.py`). The replay,
scenario table, payoff curve, Monte Carlo, recommendations and the API adapters all call it.

| Product | What the investor receives at maturity |
|---|---|
| **ELN**: Equity-Linked Note (barrier / reverse-convertible style) | Principal plus coupon, unless the barrier was breached **and** the final level is below the strike. Then `principal × final / strike + coupon`. |
| **CPN**: Capital-Protected Note | `principal × (protection + min(participation × max(0, final − 1), cap))`. With no cap the upside is unlimited. |
| **DCD**: Dual Currency Deposit | Deposit plus interest. If the FX rate ends beyond the strike, repaid in the alternate currency at the strike, valued back in the deposit currency at the final rate. |

Conventions (identical everywhere):

- **Percentages are relative** to the start level: strike 100 % is the initial level, barrier 75 % is 75 % of it.
- **ELN barrier** is observed on **every daily close** by default (`barrier_monitoring: daily`); `maturity` compares only the final
  close. A close exactly on the barrier is *not* a breach. The strike defaults to 100 % of the start price.
- **ELN coupon** is paid regardless of the barrier unless `coupon_conditional` is set, in which case a breach forfeits it.
- **DCD interest** accrues by contractual calendar days ÷ 365 from the trade date. The strike is re-struck at the same offset from
  spot in every historical window, so history is not compared against today's absolute level.
- **Notional scales money, not returns.** Changing the notional never changes the percentage outcome.

### Tech stack

| Component | Technology | Role |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| **Backend** | Python 3.13, FastAPI 0.115, Starlette, Pydantic 2, Uvicorn | REST API, validation, middleware (auth, rate limiting) |
| **Quant and data** | NumPy, pandas, SciPy, yfinance, PyYAML | Payoffs, rolling windows, block-bootstrap Monte Carlo, Black-Scholes / Garman-Kohlhagen sanity pricing, price feed |
| **Frontend** | React 19, TypeScript 6, Vite 8, Recharts 3, React Router 7 | RM workspace, client portal, dashboards, charts |
| **Auth and storage** | Supabase Auth, PostgreSQL (psycopg2) | Sign-in, role profiles, cases, runs, audit chain |
| **Explanations** | Groq, Anthropic or OpenAI (optional) | Narrates computed facts only; deterministic template fallback |
| **DevOps and QA** | Docker, nginx, GitHub Actions, pytest, Vitest, oxlint | Containers, CI, tests, linting |

### Design rules

- **One source of truth for each concern.** One set of payoff formulas, one set of historical windows, one price source, one
  suitability decision path and one explainer. `/api/analyze` and `/api/assess` return identical checks for the same client and
  product (pinned by `tests/test_unified_engine.py`).
- **Deterministic first, LLM last.** Payoffs, replay results and suitability are computed in code. The LLM only narrates facts.
- **Config-driven.** Product bounds, stress shocks, rates, issuer credit, suitability thresholds and the underlying whitelist
  live in YAML, not in code.
- **Offline-capable.** Prices fall back live → disk cache (12 h) → bundled seed CSVs, and every response states which source
  was used and the `as_of` date.

---

## 🧠 How a Decision is Made

```
configure product ─► validate terms ─► fetch prices (one source)
        ─► payoff curve · scenarios · rolling-window statistics · Monte Carlo
        ─► 20-scenario historical replay
        ─► suitability assessment ─► explanation ─► audit record
```

### Suitability engine

Every verdict is produced by `backend/app/assessment/unified.py`:

| Layer | Checks | Effect on verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Core rules** (`rules_engine.py`) | Risk appetite (structure **and** worst historical period), investment horizon, loss tolerance (worst historical loss vs. tolerance), concentration vs. liquid net worth | Decisive |
| **Compliance gates** | AML level, FATCA, vulnerable client, stale profile. *No screening on file ⇒ REVIEW, never silently clean.* | Decisive |
| **Profile checks** (`extra_checks.py`) | Product complexity vs. experience, life stage, affordability, liquidity needs | Decisive |
| **Notes** | Currency risk, indicative-pricing sanity, KYC data completeness | Informational only |

Outcome: any `FAIL` → **NOT_SUITABLE**, any `REVIEW` → **REVIEW_REQUIRED** (shown as *conditionally suitable* in the analysis
views), otherwise **SUITABLE**. A high coupon never offsets a failed check, and capital protection is never described as risk-free:
issuer credit risk is shown as an explicit figure.

### Explanations

`backend/app/explain/engine.py` serves both `/api/analyze` and `/api/assess`. For each audience (client and RM) it:

1. builds structured **facts** from the deterministic results (no client name or free text is ever included);
2. asks the configured LLM for a JSON explanation, if one is configured;
3. **validates** it: verdict wording, failed checks stated as failures, no banned phrases (“guaranteed”, “risk-free” …),
   no compliance detail in client text, CPN text mentions issuer dependence, and **every number must exist in the facts**;
4. otherwise falls back to a deterministic **template** (so the app works fully offline with `LLM_PROVIDER=none`).

Clients receive a **redacted view**: no compliance-screening results, no KYC-completeness notes and no RM briefing.

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ (tested on 3.13)
- Node 20+ (tested on 22)
- A PostgreSQL database and a Supabase project (local via the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli), or hosted)
- Optional: Docker Desktop, and an LLM key (Groq, Anthropic or OpenAI) for model-written explanations

### 1. Configuration

The backend, frontend, Docker and scripts all read **one** file: `.env` at the repo root.

```bash
cp .env.example .env               # then fill in DATABASE_URL and the SUPABASE_* values
```

### 2. Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 3. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install                        # reads SUPABASE_URL / SUPABASE_ANON_KEY from the root .env
npm run dev                        # http://localhost:5173 (proxies /api to :8000)
```

### 4. Supabase and demo data

1. Apply `supabase/migrations/20261003000000_create_user_profiles.sql` (`supabase db reset` locally, or `supabase link` + `supabase db push`).
2. Put the project URL and keys in the root `.env`. Only `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` reach the browser bundle; **the service-role key stays server-only.**
3. Seed the fictitious dataset (clients, RMs, Supabase users, case records) from `backend/`:

   ```bash
   python scripts/seed_india_data.py
   ```

   The dataset files are no longer kept in the repository (they held demo credentials). Place your own
   `clients_india.json` and `relationship_managers_india.json` in the repository root before running it; skip this step if your
   database and Supabase project are already populated.

### 5. Market seed data (optional, needs internet once)

```bash
cd backend && python scripts/build_seed.py   # writes data/seed/*.csv so demos run offline
```

### Command-line tools

```bash
cd backend
python -m app.simulation.sim_engine run tests/sample_inputs/eln_100.json --index 0   # replay one product
python -m app.simulation.sim_engine check tests/sample_inputs/dcd_100.json          # validate a products file
python -m scripts.run_assessment_batch --sim path/to/simulation_output.json         # every client vs. one product
```

---

## 🔌 Ports and Deployment

### Environment endpoints

| Environment | Component | URL / Port | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Local dev** | Frontend (Vite) | <http://localhost:5173> | Proxies `/api` to the backend |
| **Local dev** | FastAPI backend | <http://localhost:8000> | REST API |
| **Local dev** | Swagger UI | <http://localhost:8000/docs> | Interactive OpenAPI docs |
| **Local dev** | Health check | <http://localhost:8000/health> | Liveness, outside `/api` |
| **Docker** | App (nginx + SPA) | <http://localhost:8080> | nginx serves the SPA and proxies `/api` |
| **Docker** | Backend | <http://localhost:8000> | Also published for a local `npm run dev` |
| **External** | PostgreSQL and Auth | Supabase (hosted or local CLI) | Cases, runs, audit chain, accounts |

### Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env               # fill in (skip if you already have it)
docker compose up --build
```

- App: <http://localhost:8080> (nginx serves the SPA and proxies `/api` to the backend).
- The root `.env` provides the backend's runtime settings and the frontend's public `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` build arguments.
- **Always pass `--build` after pulling changes**: plain `docker compose up` reuses the previously built image.
- The compose file sets `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true` so rate limiting sees real client IPs behind nginx. Leave it `false` when the
  API is exposed directly.
- The backend image runs as a non-root user and has a health check on `/health`.

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment variables (root `.env`; template in [`.env.example`](.env.example))

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string (cases, runs, audit, registration) | required for DB-backed routes |
| `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase Auth (backend token validation and the frontend client) | required |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Account provisioning and demo seeding (**backend only**) | required for onboarding |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | `groq` \| `anthropic` \| `openai` \| `none` | `none` |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` / `LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL` | Provider key and model id (leave the model empty for the provider default) | empty |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated allowed browser origins | `http://localhost:5173` |
| `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED`, `RATE_LIMIT_SCALE` | Toggle rate limiting; multiply every limit | `true`, `1.0` |
| `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` | Read the client IP from `X-Forwarded-For` (only behind a trusted proxy) | `false` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `DEBUG` \| `INFO` \| `WARNING` \| `ERROR` | `INFO` |

The frontend build reads `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from the same file (public by design); nothing else in it reaches the browser.

### YAML configuration (`backend/config/`)

| File | Controls |
|---|---|
| `products.yaml` | Defaults, parameter bounds, recommendation grids, stress shocks, risk-free rates, issuer credit assumptions, replay / Monte Carlo settings, crisis presets |
| `underlyings.yaml` | The underlying whitelist: tickers, currency, asset class, illustrative dividend yield |
| `suitability_rules.yaml` | Profile-check thresholds, scoring weights, banned explanation phrases |
| `registration.yaml` | KYC / RM onboarding rules, client thresholds (age, allocation, income multiples) |

---

---

## 🔐 Security and Operations

| Concern | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Authentication** | Supabase Auth. The backend validates every bearer token (cached for 60 s) and loads the user's profile. |
| **Authorisation** | A single **Relationship Manager** role with all permissions. Clients can only read their own cases and runs and receive a redacted view of suitability and explanations. |
| **Rate limiting** | In-process sliding window, evaluated before authentication. Per-IP ceiling of 300 / min, plus per-token limits: onboarding 10 / min, analysis and replay routes 20 / min, market data 60 / min. State is per process; use a shared store (e.g. Redis) for a cluster-wide hard limit. |
| **Input validation** | Pydantic models with finite-number checks and bounds from YAML; DCD strikes must be within 0.5×–2× of spot; principal ≤ 10¹². |
| **LLM safety** | Facts only, no free text, output validated, template fallback, and a circuit breaker that disables calls after a 401 / 403 / 404 from the provider. |
| **Audit** | Append-only SHA-256 hash chain (`prev_hash + payload_hash`) in PostgreSQL. Tamper-evident, **not** tamper-proof. |
| **Secrets** | `.env` files are git-ignored; the service-role key never reaches the browser. |
| **Containers** | Non-root backend, health checks, `.dockerignore` excludes env files and caches. |

---

## 🧪 Testing and CI

```bash
# Backend: 237 tests, fully offline (in-memory stores, mocked Supabase, synthetic prices). No database needed.
cd backend && python -m pytest -q

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build
```

What the backend suite pins down:

- **Payoff correctness:** hand-worked golden cases and randomised path tests proving the path functions and vector adapters never diverge.
- **Consistency:** the replay's worst scenario equals the statistics' worst window; `/api/analyze` and `/api/assess` produce identical checks.
- **Security:** authentication middleware, per-user case isolation, client redaction, rate limiting, Supabase token verification, audit-chain tampering.
- **Robustness:** input validation, market-data cleaning and fallbacks, LLM validation and fallback.

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the backend tests, frontend lint / type-check / tests / build, and builds both Docker images.

## 🚨 Known Limitations and Disclaimers

**Modelling**

- **Barrier monitoring** is daily-close (`daily`, default) or final-close (`maturity`). Continuous monitoring needs intraday data the
  price sources do not provide, so it is not offered; daily-close monitoring slightly understates breach frequency.
- **No early redemption.** Notes are modelled as held to maturity. Liquidity risk is not modelled.
- **Issuer credit** is a generic illustrative assumption (`issuer_credit` in `products.yaml`), not the rating of a specific bank.
- **Pricing** is an indicative Black-Scholes / Garman-Kohlhagen sanity check with illustrative dividend yields. It is not an issuer quote.
- **Prices** are split-adjusted but not dividend-adjusted; barriers and strikes reference the traded price.
- **DCD maximum loss** is measured over the plotted exchange-rate range (−20 % … +25 %), not to infinity.
- **Numeric precision.** Payoffs use IEEE floats and are rounded for display. A booking or settlement system must use decimals.
- **“ML” is honest.** The Monte Carlo is a block-bootstrap simulation, labelled *statistical model-based, not a forecast*. No model is trained.

**Product and process**

- The replay engine can only replay the **whitelisted underlyings** in `config/underlyings.yaml`; it has no price downloader of its own.
- An unscreened client's AML gate is **REVIEW**, so clients who register through the questionnaire reach at best *conditionally suitable*.
- Any RM can read every client case. RM registration does not verify credentials against a live regulator.
- Suitability thresholds are **illustrative and pending compliance review** (`rules_engine.py`, `suitability_rules.yaml`, `registration.yaml`).
- The audit chain is a prototype control. Seeded accounts and `DEMO-TAX-*` values are test fixtures, not real identities.
